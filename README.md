# Temporal posed and spontaneous gesture recognition from electromyography in the Rock-Paper-Scissors game
This repository contains code for recognizing **posed** and **spontaneous** self-gestures, as well as predicting **opponent gestures**, using EMG signals recorded during Rock-Paper-Scissors gameplay.

## Project Structure
- `opponent_gesture_prediction/`
- `self_gesture_recognition_posed/`
- `self_gesture_recognition_spontaneous/`
- `data/` (place dataset downloaded from [OSF](https://osf.io/fmrea))

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:**
2. Download dataset from OSF and place it in the data/ folder.
3. Run preprocessing and training scripts.
